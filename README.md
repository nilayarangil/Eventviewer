# **Course Management System with Django**

This wiki documents the **Course Management System** that I built as part of my learning journey in web development using **Django, SQLite, and Python**. The system is designed specifically to help users create, manage, and view courses in an educational setting. Below is a breakdown of the project, its functionality, setup, and how it works.

## **1. Project Overview**

The **Course Management System** is a web application built with Django to enable administrators to manage educational courses. The system provides a simple interface for:



* **Course Creation**: Admins can create and manage courses.
* **Course Listing**: Users can view all available courses.

The project uses **SQLite** as the database backend for simplicity and ease of setup. Django’s built-in ORM is utilized to handle the database operations.

## **3. Conclusion**

Building this **Course Management System** with Django, SQLite, and Python has been an excellent learning experience. It allowed me to understand how Django works with models, views, and templates to create a functional web application. This project gave me hands-on experience with the Django admin panel and basic database management.
